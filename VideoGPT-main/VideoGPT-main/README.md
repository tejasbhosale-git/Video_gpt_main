# VideoGPT
GPT works only on images . well here is the video version . feel free to upload any length of video. 
even it surprises me that it can process a full 1.5 hr length ml lecture video by Andrew Ng and generate notes and answer your prompts. and also it does not use subtitle. you can upload any video. and it will work.
In only just 2 minutes . isn't it fascinating.
whereas GPT4o promised us they will be able to answer video prompts.

and also github isn't allowing me to upload the main file so i am uploading some instances .

for ml lecture notes just see edunotes1.txt and edunotes2.txt

and in output1 and output2 , i have tried to get description of video from the model.




Just for purely experimental reasons ,
a incident happened .few days ago i had some skin itches . and i told my brother to click a video of it . and when i uploaded the video to the model it gave me    **medical named png file
and the video is on IMG_8091.MOV. and well later that that day when i met the doctor he told me i have the exact same thing Pityriasis rosea.

kindly check it out.
also it's my first time uploading a project so kindly forgive me for my mistakes.
